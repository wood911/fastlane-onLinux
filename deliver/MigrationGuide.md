## deliver migration guide to 1.0

### Why breaking changes?

Originally _deliver_ was designed to be "The Continuous Delivery tool for iOS". With the introduction of [_fastlane_](https://fastlane.tools) many things have changed. It was time for a big rewrite for _deliver_, which is one of the most popular tools of the [fastlane toolchain](https://fastlane.tools).

### What do I have to do to get my setup working again?

In general, check out the latest documentation for the [Deliverfile](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/).

With 1.0 the app will not be submitted to Review by default. You can use the `fastlane deliver --submit_for_review` to submit after the upload.

#### Standard Setups (one app)

The easiest way is to remove the existing `Deliverfile` (which is probably almost empty anyway) and clear the `metadata` folder and run `deliver init`, so that _deliver_ creates everything in the new format for you.

#### Advanced Setups

To manually migrate setups (especially if you make heavy use of the `Deliverfile`):

Make sure to adapt the paths to include the _fastlane_ directory (if necessary).

**The following options have been removed from the `Deliverfile`:**

Removed     | Use instead              | Note
---------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------

`success`| [_fastlane_](https://fastlane.tools) |
`error` | [_fastlane_](https://fastlane.tools) |
`email` | `username` |
`apple_id` |  `app` | use `app_identifier` to specify the bundle identifier instead
`version` | `app_version` | is usually automatically detected
`default_language` | | 
`config_json_folder` | | No more support for JSON based configuration
`hide_transporter` | | This might be implemented at a later point
`primary_subcategories` | `primary_first_sub_category` and `primary_second_sub_category` |
`secondary_subcategories` | `secondary_first_sub_category` and `secondary_second_sub_category` |

**The following options have been changed:**

- _deliver_ now uses [_spaceship_](https://spaceship.airforce) to communicate with ï£¿. This has *huge* advantages over the old way, which means _deliver_ is now much faster and more stable :rocket: 
- Removed a lot of legacy code. Did you know _deliver_ is now one year old? A lot of things have changed since then
- Improved the selection of the newly uploaded build and waiting for processing to be finished, which is possible thanks to _spaceship_
- Updating the app metadata and uploading of the screenshots now happen using _spaceship_ instead of the iTunes Transporter, which means changes will immediately visible after running _deliver_ :sparkles: 
- Removed the `deliver beta` and `testflight` commands, as there is now a dedicated tool called [_pilot_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/pilot/)
- All parameters are now in the config system, which means you can pass values using the `Deliverfile`, from within your `Fastfile` or as command line parameter

- The preview doesn't highlight changes with blue any more
- Screenshot are uploaded every time. This is on the [next-tasks list](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/2212)

If you run into any issues with the new version of _deliver_ please submit an issue on GitHub.
