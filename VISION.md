# _fastlane_’s Philosophy

_fastlane_ automates the beta and release deployment process for your iOS or Android apps, including build, code signing, automatic screenshot capture, and distribution of your app binaries.

_fastlane_ will continue to evolve in ways that make it indispensable for, and focused on these needs.

_fastlane_ aims to be elegant in success, and empathetic in failure.

_fastlane_ provides intelligent defaults for options, prompts for missing information, and a context that automatically shares relevant information between actions. All of this allows a simple, elegant Fastfile to do a lot of powerful work.

Since errors are inevitable, _fastlane_ should show empathy and provide a suggested solution, or attempt to solve the problem automatically. Errors that can be anticipated should not crash _fastlane_, and should present users with a friendly message that is easy to spot in their terminal or logs.

## Actions and Plugins

_fastlane_ saw a lot of early growth through a wide number of actions that meet a variety of needs. Actions can trigger built-in _fastlane_ tools, talk to external tools and services, and more. However, with more than 170 built-in actions, further growth here will make _fastlane_ harder to understand and get started with. Another consideration is that actions which ship with _fastlane_ represent a maintenance cost for the _fastlane_ core team.

With these challenges in mind, [_fastlane_ plugin system](https://fabric.io/blog/introducing-fastlane-plugins/) allows anyone to develop, share, and use new actions built and maintained by the awesome _fastlane_ community. If you have an idea for a new _fastlane_ action, [create it as a plugin](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/create-plugin/) and it’ll be automatically listed in the [_fastlane_ plugin registry](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/available-plugins). The most impactful and commonly used plugins could be adopted into _fastlane_ in the future.

## _fastlane_’s Relationship with [Google](https://google.com)

Google supports app development teams with the best tools for building, understanding, and growing their mobile app businesses through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/).

Google has recognized _fastlane_ as the best tool for tackling tough beta and release deployment challenges. The team’s mission is to make _fastlane_ the de facto tool to automate beta deployments and app store releases for iOS and Android apps.

Google intends to keep _fastlane_ open source and available as a standalone tool for users who are not using Firebase or Fabric. Google is also committed to increasing use of _fastlane_ by promoting it through other products and websites, and developing integrations with Firebase and Fabric tools to help them work better together.
